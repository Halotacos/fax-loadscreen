# Musical Loading Screen
**About**
Ever get tired of your 1 song in your loading screen and wish you could have more songs. Well this script may solve your issue. Musical Load Screen can have ‘unlimited’ songs in the loading screen. It will pick a random song and play it whilst you load in. Currently by default there is 5 songs but you can add more easily.

I decided to release this as I only know of 2 servers that have this (Mine & HSG’s). So I’m sharing it today with all of you. If you have issues regarding the sound(s) comment below.

**NOTES**
This is my own edits for the main resource. I was doing this for City of Houston RP as we had problems with our players having loud music playing in there ears. PLease note I'm a small time coder, if my edits screw up let me know so I can fix them! 
**Thanks ~NEP**

**Installation**
Go to the main resource

**Requirements**
None. This is a standalone resource

**FAQ**

**The loading image does not work?**
Make sure the loading image its called *loadscreen.jpg* in that casing.

**I tried everything what do I do?**
Download a fresh copy as it works and relook through your code.

If you can’t host songs yourself. DM him on discord (FAXES#8655) and he can help you.
